# Realm Factory

Welcome to the Realm Factory project!

Initial development on this project happened primarily back in about 2010 to 2013, and because it has been sitting around collecting dust for a while, I've decided it is reasonable to just open source it.
It's something I've been considering since even Day 1, but wasn't sure of.

In 2021, we took some big steps to modernize this project:

1. Switched it over to target MonoGame instead of XNA.
2. Upgraded it to .NET Framework 4.8.
3. Made it so you could use the latest Visual Studio (VS 2019).

There are still some other modernization efforts we'd like to undertake going forward:

1. The big one is porting to .NET Core or .NET 5. There were some resolution issues that came up with that conversion when we tried it, but we're confident there's a solution for it.
2. There has been some discussion around changing the UI technology from WinForms to something else. WPF has been thrown around quite a bit, but something web-related may also be more future proof. That's a bigger undertaking, and I don't think we expect it to happen in the next little while.

## Contributing

I'm happy to have people try to help me take this further.
I'd be happy to help guide development aimed at addressing any of the other issues listed in the repository as well.
If you've got another thing besides those that you'd like to work on, feel free to contact me or add an issue to the project and we can go down that path as well.
